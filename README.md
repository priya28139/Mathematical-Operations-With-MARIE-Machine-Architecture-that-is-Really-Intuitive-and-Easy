# Mathematical-Operations-With-MARIE-Machine-Architecture-that-is-Really-Intuitive-and-Easy
the assembly code performs an input validation to ensure the input for any mathematical operation is a decimal value between 0 and 9 inclusive. Decimal values may be input in the DEC/HEX format as needed. Any other character  (operator symbol or any other) needs to be specifically input in the ASCII format.  Hence, in order to quit from a specific operation, set the mode to ASCII and input any character. The subtraction operation reads the minimum value that the result may  reach, and this may clearly be a negative value. The input for the said field may hence  be negative but requires the mode to be set to DEC. For any operation, the input of a  non-decimal character causes the program to go back to eliciting choice for a new  operation to be performed. To terminate the program, the input of any character but the +, -, * or / for the operation suffices. All operations are supported for non-negative  single digit decimals. For the division operation, the input of 0 as a divisor, causes an  exit from the operation back to the menu. In the event that the divisor is greater than the dividend, the  quotient hence obtained is zero. For the subtraction operation, when the result may go  below the desired minimum, the operation is quit to revert back to the menu.
